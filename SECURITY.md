## Disclosing a security issue

This repo leverages GitHub's private vulnerability reporting. To learn more about this feature and how to submit a vulnerability report,
review [GitHub's documentation on private reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Here are some helpful details to include in your report:

- a detailed description of the issue
- the steps required to reproduce the issue
- versions of the project that may be affected by the issue
- if known, any mitigations for the issue

Given the demo nature of this project, we do not make any commitments to the timeframe within which reports will receive a response. 

If you've been unable to successfully draft a vulnerability report via GitHub
or have other concerns about the security of this demo repo, please
reach out via the [Cisco Open security contact email](mailto:oss-security@cisco.com).

## Vulnerability management

Maintainers may choose to act on a disclosure report, but given the "as-is" nature of this demo project, no commitments are made. 

## Suggesting changes

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit an
issue or pull request.
